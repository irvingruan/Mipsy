A simple MIPS simulator written in MIPS that’s able to process 32-bit MIPS instructions. 

Author: Irving Ruan

Under /tests you can see simulated MIPS instructions, and running the MIPS simulator under Mars (a MIPS simulator written in Java, which you can download at <http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/Mars/download.htm>) with the test cases will yield the correct output.
